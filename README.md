# Hello! It is my DNA-replication project

## What is the point

We have the sequence of the first DNA stand. The second stand is built according to the complementarity rule. The nucleotide A(adenine) is complementary to the nucleotide T(Thymine), and the nucleotide C(Cytosine) is complementary to G(Guanine).
